# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 

1. Revisited Question 1.4 to 1.9 in cracking the coding interview.
2. Question 1.4 Palindromic Permutation. Understood the logic behind bit vector manipulation. Similar to the one in 1.2. Learned how to negate a bit and also to check if it's a power of two:
  - To negate nth bit do AND with (Integer.MAX) - (2 ^ n). 
  For eg: 010001 where 2nd position needs to be negated. 
  111111 - 010000 = 101111; 010001 & 101111 = 000001
  - To check power of 2 condition: [n & (n-1) = 0]. Eg: 010000 & 001111 = 000000; 010001 & 010000 = 010000;
3. Question 1.5 One Away: Changed to a clear logic. Replacing and Inserting a character has similar logic with just pointer position changing.
4. Question 1.6: StringCompression. Piece of Cake!
5. Question 1.7: RotateMatrix. Implemented it again to get it cleared. Note: Swapping 4 variables.
6. Question 1.8: ZeroMatrix. Easy one. Revisited the best implementation[Book].
7. Question 1.9: StringRotation. Easy one. Remember the way from Book.
8. LinkedList implementation. Basic.

**Thoughts:** 

1. Very Slow Progress Today.
2. Learned something in bit manipulation.
3. Struggled with RotateMatrix. Forgot the logic although really simple one. Always write on paper to solve Matrix problems.
4. ZeroMatrix I remembered the best method but didn't have the confidence to work it out :(
5. String Rotation was a interesting one!
6. +1 to myself to implement Generics in LinkedList :)

**Hours Spent:** 3.5 hours

End of Chapter 1 and LinkedList Implementation. Chapter 2 Begins Tomorrow. Some rough start to the Streak :|

### Day 0: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 

1. Revisited LinkedList chapter in cracking the coding interview book.
2. Solved a really simple question to link up alternate nodes. [AlternateLinking.java](https://github.com/sudharti/cracking-the-code/blob/master/src/chapter_2/additional/AlternateLinking.java). Took almost an Hour and Half for some reason :(
3. Question 2.1 Revisited. Really simple one. Took a long time to complete this one.
4. Corrected functionality in CustomLinkedList implementation of mine.

**Thoughts:** 

1. Bad F****** Day! Some Mind Block caused me to work so slow. Even simple logic seemed difficult.
2. I am cursing myself now.
3. Took 1.5 hours for a simple solution I thought at first. But the worst was yet to come.
4. Even those who are new to programming will find it easier. The thing is I knew the logic and Algo and Implementing looked hard for me. GOD I am so f***** up if this continues.
5. Not much of Learning today. Worse than ever to solve the most easiest problems in the WORLD!!!!!
6. -1 to myself to implement Generics in LinkedList :)

**Hours Spent:** 4 hours [Duh!]

This is not so good for my Streak :(
