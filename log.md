# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 

1. Revisited Question 1.4 to 1.9 in cracking the coding interview.
2. Question 1.4 Palindromic Permutation. Understood the logic behind bit vector manipulation. Similar to the one in 1.2. Learned how to negate a bit and also to check if it's a power of two:
  - To negate nth bit do AND with (Integer.MAX) - (2 ^ n). 
  For eg: 010001 where 2nd position needs to be negated. 
  111111 - 010000 = 101111; 010001 & 101111 = 000001
  - To check power of 2 condition: [n & (n-1) = 0]. Eg: 010000 & 001111 = 000000; 010001 & 010000 = 010000;
3. Question 1.5 One Away: Changed to a clear logic. Replacing and Inserting a character has similar logic with just pointer position changing.
4. Question 1.6: StringCompression. Piece of Cake!
5. Question 1.7: RotateMatrix. Implemented it again to get it cleared. Note: Swapping 4 variables.
6. Question 1.8: ZeroMatrix. Easy one. Revisited the best implementation[Book].
7. Question 1.9: StringRotation. Easy one. Remember the way from Book.

**Thoughts:** 

1. Very Slow Progress Today.
2. Learned something in bit manipulation.
3. Struggled with RotateMatrix. Forgot the logic although really simple one. Always write on paper to solve Matrix problems.
4. ZeroMatrix I remembered the best method but didn't have the confidence to work it out :(
4. String Rotation was a interesting one!
